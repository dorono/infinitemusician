WordPress Persistent Login keeps users logged into your website forever, unless they explicitly log out. Similar to the functionality of Facebook.

== Description ==

WordPress Persistent Login is a simple plugin that keeps users logged into your website unless they explicitly choose to log-out. 

It requires no set-up, simply install and save your users time by keeping them logged into your website securely. This plugin will eliminate any session expired/please log-in messages that users might see as well as avoid the annoyance of forgetting usernames/passwords.


== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin
2. Install the plugin onto your WordPress website
3. Activate the plugin

If you'd like to test that the plugin works, follow these steps (after you've completed those above):

1. Quit your browser
2. Open your browser and log back into your website (this will activate WP Persistent Login for you)
3. Quit your browser again
4. Visit your website again and you should be automatically logged in
