Adds custom sections to the Storefront homepage.

== Description ==

A simple plugin that adds custom homepage sections to the Storefront theme - includes a slider configurable via the Customizer.
1. Select from products or sticky posts as slider content. 
2. Set slider mode - slide or fade. 
3. Set slider direction for the slide mode.
4. Set number of items to cycle through the slider.

Adds 4 additional widget areas - a tripple widget section plus a fullwidth widget where you can add any content you desire.
1. Create a shout out/announcement or a call to action using the fullwidth widget. Tip: You can add any content you like here :)
3. Creat eye grabbing content via the 3 widgets in the triple widget section. Tip: Here too, you are in control of the content :)

Version 1.0.1 now has the option to add a title and tagline for the tripple widget section. This can be done via the Customizer.

NOTE: This plugin requires the Storefront theme to be installed. The Homepage Control plugin is highly recommended!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `storefront-homepage-extra-sections` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure the display in the Customizer (look for the 'Homepage Contact' section).
3. Done!
