WooCommerce Email Customizer plugin allows you to fully customize the styling, colors, logo and text in the emails sent from your WooCommerce store.

== Description ==

Create Beautiful Customized WooCommerce Emails:
Email Customizer enables full customization of your WooCommerce emails. Customize colors, header & footer format, add custom links, link to your social networks, and now even customize what the email says. You no longer need to be a developer to do this.

Currently customization is something that only a developer can do by going into the code and editing the template files, which isn't really an option for a non-programmer. We wanted to give you an environment that is simple to use, gives you a live preview of your customizations, and can send a test email when you are done. That's what Email Customizer for WooCommerce does.

The plugin also adds functionality to your WooCommerce Orders page so you are able to open a preview of any of the email templates (New Order, Invoice, Processing Order, etc), and send/resend that email to your customer or yourself.

Email Customizer for WooCommerce has made managing the email communications sent from our store much simpler and more beautiful - making our whole operation look and sounds as solid as it is. We think it can do the same for you.

Great For
* Customizing of the  the styling, colors, header & footer format, add custom links, link to your social networks, and now even customize what the email says.
* Tailor what your customer reads and sees, before you send it - helping your operation to look and sound as solid as it is.
* Developers who can now also easily preview changes as they develop, modify or enhance their email template files.
* Shop Managers who want to preview & send/resend emails (New Order, Invoice, etc) right from the WooCommerce Order page.

Happy Conversions!

== Changelog ==

= 3.04 =
* We have chosen not to include a .pot (template) with our plugin as it can lead to our .pot being out of date and missing strings that you require, so you can create your own .pot (template). Or you can skip that and go straight to creating your language file. Please save your language files to this location that Loco Translate suggests: /wp-content/languages/plugins/email-control-en_US.po. Please see the /languages/guide.txt for a step-by-step guide.
* Small changes to some of the text, tip text & layout in the Email Customizer.
* Fix issue in very small browser windows where the customizer sections would not be high enough to display the fields inside them.

= 3.03 =
* Added new shortcodes `[ec_delivery_note]` `[ec_shipping_method]` `[ec_payment_method]` `[ec_custom_field]`.
* Allow for customizing of the text on the `[ec_pay_link text="..."]` and `[ec_reset_password_link text="..."]`.
* Read more about these, and all our shortcodes, in our new "Shortcodes" documentation https://www.cxthemes.com/documentation/email-customizer/shortcodes-email-customizer/.

= 3.02 =
* Fixed unique characters being stripped from the urls when saving custom Links.

= 3.01 =
* Fixed curl notice in the email preview when using Email Customizer with 3rd party email sending plugins.
* Fixed notice about `get_image_id()` when using product images in the email templates.
* Fixed issue when sending test emails in the customizer where email would erroneously send to the order email address and not the test email address.

= 3.00 =
* We're excited to announce a new template called Vanilla. It's modern, clean and bold and brings with it responsive layouts so it looks great on mobile email clients that support it. It also brings with it Product Images so your customers can see and get excited about what they're buying. And we didn't just add these features to Vanilla, we've added them to all our templates. We hope you like our new look.
* Added Responsive layouts to all the email templates so they look great on mobile email clients that support it.
* Added Product Images to all the email templates with an option to toggle them on or off.
* Replace tip-tip js plugin with simpler and more conventional 'title' attributes which leads to quicker loading & simpler interface.
* Fixed persistent bug showing a notice about `plain_text` in some versions of WC.

= 2.42 =
* Fix issue where template would show undefined variable `plain_text` when using WC2.5.4 and lower.
* Fixed the Links panel not being able to scroll to the lower links with smaller windows sizes.
* Fixed double slash in the preview URL that would result in the customizer not loading for some people.
* Changed to a new method to render the emails in the preview that uses the email trigger method to capture the rendered email.

= 2.41 =
* Start using WooCommerce Emogrifier class, exclusively, to merge the CSS into the Email HTML. Previously we needed our own version of this class as it was not yet available in older versions of WooCommerce. This means that the emails will be more consistently rendered. It also means you'll need WC version 2.3 or higher.
* Change the minimum required version of WooCommerce to version 2.3

= 2.40 =
* We have unfortunately removed the Email Customizer action box from the WooCommerce Order page. We felt the feature can lead to confusion as it's email-send functionality is a duplication of the WooCommerce Order Actions, and the emails may not send in the case of a note-email, or third-part customer emails. We also felt that previewing of all the order emails is done in the Email Customizer interface so it's not needed that the functionality is duplicated here. We apologise if this anyone is unhappy with what we felt like was a necessary decision.
* Changed the way we render our customizer - using more css and less reliant on JS (which can fail).
* Replaced Fontawesome icon fonts with Fontello to prevent collisions with other plugins and reduce load time by only loading the icons we need.

= 2.39 =
* Fix custom navigation links not working in Deluxe email template.

= 2.37 =
* We've changed the way we do plugin auto-updates so we can better manage the demand for our plugins and updates. You will now be notified - as usual - about new available plugin updates. Then we'll require you to save your CodeCanyon purchase-code for our plugin - first time only - which will enable this and any future auto-updates. If you're not sure where to get your purchase code - don't worry, it will be explained in the plugin.
