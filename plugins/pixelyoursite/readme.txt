<strong>PixelYourSite Key Features:</strong></br>

* You can **insert the pixel on every page of your website with just ONE click**. No need to edit any posts or pages

* **Optimize your site for Facebook Custom Audiences.** We add a special event (GeneralEvent) on every page that will send Facebook key parameters, like content name, content ID, category name and post type. You can use them to create super-powerful Custom Audiences to retarget with your ads, or to expand your reach with Lookalike Audiences (we have a free guide and helpful articles on how to do it)

* **Search Event** on the search page with the search string pulled as parameter - super useful for creating search based Custom Audiences

>**How to use the Search Event:**
>
Retargeting the users that performed a search on your site is a smart strategy because this is a highly engaged audience that knows you and it's interested in what you offer.
>
>It can be a good idea to go a little further and create Custom Audiences based on a few important keywords that potential buyers might search for.

* **Delay Events**, so you don't spend your money on retargeting bouncing visitors.

* You can turn ON/OFF the pixel based on user roles (remove it for admins, editors and so on)

* You can **set up and track Standard or Custom Events** and add parameters for each of them

* All the events will have a **domain name parameter**, so you can easily create Custom Audiences from events when you have more than one site

* **Traffic Source and URL tags (UTM)** are added to all the events and you can use them to create Custom Audiences based on where your visitors are coming from. It is possible to track a particular Facebook Ad too. ([Pro Version](http://www.pixelyoursite.com/facebook-pixel-plugin))

>You can create Custom Audiences based on where the traffic is coming from, like Google, Facebook or a particular referer.
>
>Additionally, if you are using URL parameters they will be tracked and added as parameters for all your events. This is extremely useful because you can create Custom Audiences from people coming from a particular ad or campaign, for example.

* **Dynamic Events:** optimize your Facebook Campaigns for actions on your website (CLICKS on links, buttons, forms, page scroll or mouse over). Works with **almost all forms or pop-up plugins.**  ([Pro Version](http://www.pixelyoursite.com/facebook-pixel-plugin))

>Fire a Dynamic Event when the visitor performs a key action on your site and optimize your ads for that event (perfect for affiliate sites, newsletter signups and so on).
>
>Additionally, you can create Custom Audiences based on dynamic events. These are people with a high interest in your products or offers and you can retarget them successfully.
>
>With PixelYourSite PRO you can fire Dynamic Events:
>
>* When a URL is clicked
>* When a CSS element is clicked (any form button, for example)
>* When the mouse is moved over a page element
>* On page scroll (scroll percent).


* Track **conversion value** for standard and custom events

* Track tags and use them for Custom Audiences ([Pro Version](http://www.pixelyoursite.com/facebook-pixel-plugin))

* Enable **Advanced Matching** - this new FB feature increases the chances to correctly identify users visiting your website without being logged to their Facebook accounts. The plugin will automatically send to Facebook the data you have about the visitors. ([Pro Version](http://www.pixelyoursite.com/facebook-pixel-plugin))

>**What's the deal with the GeneralEvent**
>
>The plugin will fire a GeneralEvent that can be used in two different ways:
>
>**1. Custom Audiences** - you can create Custom Audiences using Website Trafic > Custom Combination > Event. From here you can select the GeneralEvent and add the desired parameters.
>
>The GeneralEvent will have the following parameters:
>
>* post_id
>* post_type (it will pull the WordPress post type, like post, category and so on)
>* content_category (for posts, it will show the post category)
>* domain (it will pull the domain name - useful if you are using the pixel on more than one sites)
>* tags - pro version
>
>**How to use the GeneralEvent for Custom Audiences**
>
>**Example:** you can create a Custom Audience from people that viewed articles from one specific category in the last 30 days or people that visited articles having one or more tags, a particular page (using the name or the ID), or content that has a particular word in the name. 
>
>
>**2. Custom Conversions** - similar to Custom Audiences, you can create Custom Conversions based on the GeneralEvent.
>
>**Example:** You can define a Custom Conversion when someone reads at least 3 articles from a particular category, or when it lands on a specific page, or on any article that has a particular tag.
>

<strong>What's next<strong>

We are working on some new handy features for the plugin and we will release them soon.

<strong>Pixel Helper Errors</strong>

If you are testing your pixel with Pixel Helper Chrome Extension, it is possible that you will see some errors:

**Facebook Pixel can't match products**

It means that the product ID is not found in a Dynamic Ads Product Catalog. If you are not doing Dynamic Ads, or if that event is not Dynamic Ads related, then you are fine. Otherwise, check your product catalog feed and make sure that the product ID is present in there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
We maintain an up to date FAQ page on our site:

<strong><a href="http://www.pixelyoursite.com/facebool-pixel-master-faq" target="_blank"><span style="color:#DE4D4D;">Click here for the FAQ page</span></a></strong>

**Do I need to copy/paste the full Facebook Pixel code somewhere?**

No, you just have to enter your pixel ID in the dedicated field. The plugin will do the rest for you.

**Where can I find the Facebook Pixel ID?**

You can find it here:
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/pixel/facebook_pixel" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/pixel/facebook_pixel</a>

**Can I use the plugin for  Custom Audiences or Custom Conversions?**

Absolutely yes! Actually, the plugin will super-optimize your site for Custom Audiences and Custom Conversions. 
You will be able to create the classical ones based on URLs, but also Custom Combinations, like people who visited posts from category XYZ, or tagged with tag ABC in the last 30 days. 

Use the PRO version, and you'll be able to do crazy things, like targeting people that came from Google and visited products under category "blue widget", or clients who bought products of at least $100, using the discount coupon "promo".

**I used the old Facebook Pixel, will my audiences still work?**

Yes, they will, you won't lose anything.

**Does it work with WooCommerce?**

Yes, it does. The plugin adds all the necessary events, like ViewContent, AddToCart, InitiateCheckout and Purchase. This way you can easily track conversion and c**onversion value.**

** Do I have to manually add the events for WooCommerce?**

No, you don't, the plugin will take care of everything for you. 

**Does it work with Easy Digital Downloads?**

Yes, it works in the same way it does with WooCommerce.

**Does it work with Dynamic Ads (promote a product catalog)**

Yes, all the WooCommerce and EDD pixel events are Dynamic Ads ready. 

**Can I fire additional events if I need to?**

Of course, you can fire any type of event (standard or custom) on any URL of your site. You can also use a partial URL by adding a * at the end of it (this way all the URLs starting with that string will be targeted).

With the PRO version, you can use Dynamic Events and fire them on:

* clicks on external or internal links
* clicks on CSS elements, like form buttons
* mouse over CSS elements
* page scroll

**Will your plugin increase the loading time of my site?**

The plugin itself is really fast. However, you have to remember that the pixel has to communicate with Facebook to send all the data, and this will add a little load on your site. 

Will this impact on your visitors? No, because all the requests are asynchronous, meaning that the browser will continue to load and your users will not see any delay whatsoever.

**Are there any known incompatibilities with other themes or plugins?**

Any program, service, code or plugin that adds the Pixel Code, since you can't have two similar pixels on a page.

* We had a problem with Mamaya, a retargeting service
* It won't work with LeadPages or any similar system  because those pages are generated outside WordPress

If any incompatibilities will arise we will add them here and, of course, will try to fix them as soon is possible.

**I have the pixel installed on my website and I am running a Facebook Campaign, but the reports are confusing me. How can I see my campaign results?**

We have an article about how to create Custom Reports:
<strong><a href="http://www.pixelyoursite.com/facebook-ads-reports-optimisation" target="_blank"><span style="color:#DE4D4D;">How to optimize your Facebook Ads Reports for events tracking</span></a></strong>
